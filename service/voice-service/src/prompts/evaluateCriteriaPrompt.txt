Analyze the conversation against the provided matchmaking criteria. For each criterion, determine how thoroughly it has been explored based on the conversation content.

CRITERIA TO EVALUATE:
{{criteria}}

CONVERSATION:
{{conversation}}

For each criterion listed above, classify its exploration status:

- **fully_explored**: Enough information to make matching decisions with high confidence. Multiple clear signals, direct statements, or detailed examples that thoroughly reveal this aspect.
- **mostly_explored**: Substantial information gathered, sufficient for matching. Good understanding with some depth, though minor details may be missing.
- **partially_explored**: Some signals but need more depth. Initial information present but insufficient for confident matching decisions.
- **unexplored**: No meaningful information yet. This topic hasn't been addressed.
- **currently_active**: Active topic in last 2-3 exchanges. The conversation is actively exploring this area right now.

Examine the conversation for both direct statements and indirect signals. Consider:
- Explicit mentions of the criterion
- Stories or examples that reveal the criterion
- Behavioral patterns demonstrated in responses
- Emotional reactions that indicate underlying traits
- Values expressed through opinions or preferences
