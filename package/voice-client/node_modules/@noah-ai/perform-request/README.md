A wrapper around fetch for additional features and standard error handling

# Single Requests

A number of methods are exported for handling single request use cases.

```ts
import { postRequest } from '@noah-ai/base-client';

const data = await postRequest(
  'https://example.com/blah',
  { yay: 'woo' },
  {
    headers: { authorization: authHeader },
  },
);
```

Raw requests are also supported through the corresponding raw methods:

```ts
const data = await rawPostRequest('https://example.com/blah', {
  headers: { authorization: authHeader },
  body: new FormData(),
});
```
